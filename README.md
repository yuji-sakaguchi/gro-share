### Inspiration
Wanting to connect those who have excess food with those who need it most, creating a community-driven solution to help alleviate hunger and promote sustainability. 
Since buying in bulk is always cheaper, we wanted to create a solution to spend less money on groceries while sharing with others. This is especially helpful for students who do not have a car and cannot afford to buy expensive groceries.

### What it does

GroShare features a user-friendly interface with a login service that keeps track of user accounts. All user inputs are stored in a backend database, making it easy for users to retrieve their previous posts and track their activity on the app. 
Groshare has a homepage where you can see what other users are posting. The posts include what other users are selling their groceries for.
